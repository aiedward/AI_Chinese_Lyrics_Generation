# AI_Generate_Chinese_Lyrics
<img src="music.jpg"/>
Artificial intelligence has already been used to create a short film, snippets of angst-ridden poetry, and even the odd avant-garde melody. I have done some attempts about lyric generation with the power of AI.

## Requirements
Anaconda3 (Python3.5+)

# Usage
```bash
bash main.sh
```

## File Description
* 1-word_cloud_results: the word cloud picture of JJ Lin's (林俊杰 in Chinese) lyrics downloaded from [Netease Cloud Music](https://music.163.com).
* 2-keras_lstm_generation: lyrics generation using LSTM.
